## L + R SafeSense Project

Welcome to the L+R project repository! 
This initiative is focused on developing an advanced and integrated system designed to enhance the safety and experience of cyclists.
By leveraging a combination of helmet-mounted sensors, Bluetooth connectivity, and cutting-edge data analytics, we aim to incentivize cycling and promote greener commuting.
In addition, through our integration with XRPL (XRP Ledger), we enable a unique incentive model that offers tangible rewards for cyclists.
We're driving this project with a keen focus on mobility safety and sustainability, aligned with the principles that XRPL champions.
Here you'll find the code, resources, and discussions related to the L+R SafeSense android app prototype and more.
We invite you to explore, contribute, and join us in this exciting journey of making biking better and safer for everyone!
